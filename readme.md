# Fraud Detection Case Study

Today we will work with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study.  We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together.

Topics included in this case study include:
* Classification modeling.
* Programming Practice: Handing off models. 
* Teamwork.
* Creating a basic data tool that can support a front-end application.
* Data visualization.
* Results presentation.

#### Deliverables

We will want two deliverables from you for this project:

*  A script that pulls in new data points from a simulated data source as input, makes predictions on those datapoints, and saves the data points and their results into a database (local or cloud). 
* A five-minute presentation on your process and results. 

#### Notes

* [Overview](overview.md): gives a detailed overview of the project.  Included are *suggestions* for how you can organize your team, though this is not binding, and you are free to deviate.
* [Building your model](model_notes.md): notes on how to get started with the dataset and how to save your model once you've trained it.
